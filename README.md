# US_voting_behavior
This is a data set manually compiled from counties all around the United States. The data is partially processed; that is, some derived variables have been created. The task is to thoroughly preprocess the data by identifying the error and anomalies and proposing remedies and solutions. In the end, we have an analytics-ready version of this data. Once the preprocessing is completed, this data is pulled into RapidMiner to extract useful visual information from it. To do so, conceptualized relevant questions and hypotheses and created proper visualizations that address those questions of “tests” of those hypotheses. The goal of these hypotheses is to understand voting behavior better.  PowerPoint Presentation with the following elements: a. Identifying errors and anomalies found in the data and corresponding remedies and solutions. A table to depict this information. b. Hypotheses and corresponding visualizations to address each question. c. A summary with findings. Rapid Miner file.
